While the actual settings will change when you load a **graphic** preset, the in game menu [options->graphics/adv graphics/troubleshoot] will not reflect that. If you want to save a preset after you have used the load function, go to [options->graphics->overall graphics quality] and click on any option (or restart LotRO) to refresh the in game options menu.
