## Requirements
Either just use the [My_LotRO_Buddy.exe](https://github.com/strauss7702/My_LotRO_Buddy/releases)  
_In case you do not trust exe files you can check the file on [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url)_

**or**

Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)  
Download [classMemory.ahk](https://github.com/Kalamity/classMemory) and put it in the same folder as My_LotRO_Buddy.ahk

<br/><br/>

## Hotkey
[Pause / Break]   [Because it is one of the keys that is not assigned by default.](https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/User:Taz/Scratchpad-Commands)

While the actual settings will change when you load a preset, the in game menu [options->graphics/adv graphics/troubleshoot] will not reflect that. If you want to save a preset after you have used the load function, go to [options->graphics->overall graphics quality] and click on any option (or restart LotRO) to refresh the in game options menu.

<br/><br/>

## What is saved?
Everything in **Graphics**, **Adv Graphics** and **Troubleshoot**.
