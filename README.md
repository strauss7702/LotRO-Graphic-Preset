# LotRO-Graphic-Preset
Save and load your own graphic presets.

<br/><br/>

### Requirements
Either just use the [LotRO_GP.exe](https://github.com/strauss7702/LotRO-Graphic-Preset/releases)  
(In case you do not trust exe files you can check the file on [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url)

**or**

Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)  
Download [classMemory.ahk](https://github.com/Kalamity/classMemory) and put it in the same folder as LotRO_GP.ahk

<br/><br/>

### Hotkeys
- Save: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S  
- Load: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + L  
- Close: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + END

<br/><br/>

### How to use
- Change the settings in game to your likings, use the save hotkey, name your preset and click ok.
- Press the load Hotkey, choose a preset and click on ok.

While the actual settings will change, the in game menu [options->graphics/adv graphics/troubleshoot] will not reflect that. If you want to save a preset after you have used the load function of LotRO_GP, go to [options->graphics->overall graphics quality] and click on any option or restart LotRO.
